# NLP_LLM_quiz

This repository contains a complete pipeline for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for disease diagnosis from radiology findings. The project implements both zero-shot baselines using prompt engineering and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA) on QWen3 models.

The finetuned model can be downloaded at https://huggingface.co/jingdong00/LLMQuiz.
**Setup**
All experiments were conducted using Kaggle Notebooks with the default GPU environment, which provides access to 2Ã— NVIDIA T4 GPUs (each with 16 GB of VRAM), along with approximately 16 GB of RAM and 2 vCPUs.

The following command can install all the necessary libraries.
```bash
python3 setup.py
```

**Run Qwen3 Baselines**
```bash
python3 baseline.py
```

**Run Qwen3 Finetune with LoRA**
```bash
python3 fine_tuning.py
```
