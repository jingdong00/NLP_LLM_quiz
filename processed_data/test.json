The spleen and pancreas are normal in shape and size, and no abnormal density is seen. A few punctate high dense foci are seen in the bilateral renal collecting system; no abnormalities are seen in the bilateral ureters. No abnormally enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the retroperitoneum. Multiple patchy high dense foci are seen in the walls of the abdominal aorta and bilateral iliac arteries.",

Multiple small round low-density lesions are seen in the liver, with no enhancement after contrast injection. No obvious dilatation is seen in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. Nodular high-density lesions are seen in the gallbladder, with no obvious thickening of the gallbladder wall. The pancreas and spleen shape, size, and density are normal, and no abnormal enhancing lesions are seen in the enhanced scan.

No abnormal density is found in the liver parenchyma. The liver size is normal, and the proportion of each lobe is within the normal range. No widening of the liver fissure is observed. The spleen is not enlarged, with a smooth outer shape and uniform density in the parenchyma. The gallbladder is not enlarged, with no thickening of the wall, and no dilation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. The pancreas has a normal size, shape, and density, with clear fat gaps around it. No fluid accumulation is observed in the abdominal cavity. No enlarged lymph nodes are found in the retroperitoneum. A dot-shaped high-density focus is observed in the appendiceal cavity.",
