Justification: The absence of definite abnormalities in the liver, spleen, gallbladder, and abdominal cavity allows for the classification of this finding as normal. No specific disease labels are required. However, if there is any uncertainty, it is better to be safe and provide a label such as ""No acute abnormality found"" to indicate that no immediate pathological changes are observed.
